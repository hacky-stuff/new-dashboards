# ✨ a new dashboard approach ✨

This repository contains the result of our hack week to import and visualize Jira and GitHub issues in a dashboard; and maybe in backstage.

## Cloud Events (Event Types)

To trigger an import, and to react and analyze (enhance) the Jira and GitHub data.

## Functions

To import existing Jira and GitHub issues and to get updates via webhooks.

## Persist data

In ElasticSearch for now. Kafka might be an option if we continue with the dashboard.

## Query and visualize data

In Grafana or Kibana

## Backstage app / plugin

As iframe?
